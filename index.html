                        <p>In recent times, the international break has often been the best period in the year for Man United fans - solely because there are no United games to ruin your weekend; and oftentimes, ruin the the following week as well. Instead, we usually spend 2 weeks reminiscing about all the great (and not so great) players we used to have, that gave us memorable moments - since most of the current crop haven't been providing these for us! However, today, we will use the 3 games we've played so far to deduce the best lineup we have at our disposal, accounting for: balance, the coach's style, "form", fitness but also a certain degree of realism - choosing players that Ten Hag would most likely play himself. Before we select players, we must first decide on a formation...</p>

                            This is like a riddle that even the coaches themselves can't seem to solve - luckily I'm here to reveal the answers! 
                            In my opinion, the only issue, when it comes to the formation (we have MANY issues elsewhere) is the midfield. Do we go with a 2-man pivot or just one sitter (a '6'? Do we play with a designated attacking midfielder (10) or do we have 2 central midfielders ('8s') "sharing" that responsibilty? I personally would opt for a 6 with twin 8s either side; just to close up the gaps we constantly see in the midfield. Even though you can solve this with better coaching, it's clear that ETH isn't meeting the needed standards to this formation would be beneficial as a result. 
                            Now this has been established, the lineup will be a 4-3-3 with a 6 and two 8s.</p>

                        <p>
                            Now, I've had to adjust the team for availability, as ideally Luke Shaw would be in the lineup, but given his recent lack of availabaility for the team, and obscurity as to when he'll next play for us, he, among others, won't be included here.
                            Also, we'll have a lineup specifically for Premier League games and one for Europa League/Domestic Cup games for squad rotation and to get the younger players involved.

                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p> Goalkeeper: Onana </p>
                        <p2> Even though he has been relatively poor compared to how he ended last season, he is still undisputedly the best person for the job.</p2>

                        <p> Defence: Dalot, De Ligt, Martinez, Mazaroui </p>
                        <p2>Honestly, I didn't think this unit was too bad in their last outing against liverpool (H), especially De Ligt. As the game went on, we were seeing the back 4 become more and more exposed, and unfortunately Martinez evidently lost his head and became overly rash - which didn't do any United player any favours. De Ligt manages this well however, and still proved to be of the calibre he left Ajax at, and gave hope that he could potentially fulfil his potential here. <br> I have also switched the full-backs. Even though they have both been good - and I am a believer of the saying "If it ain't broke don't fix it", I still think this switch will serve the rest of the team better; here's where the "balance" I spoke about comes in. So far, Dalot's listed position has been at LB, but he often operates in the middle areas of the pitch in possession, leaving Rashford to hug the touchline. <br> I believe this should be mirrored on the other side, with the right winger doing this instead to enable Rashford to invert and pick up the ball in more shooting positions, because even though he has been poor for the last 12 months, one attribute he's kept this whole time is his ball-striking ability; and the fact that he hasn't had a shot on goal is criminal. So this adjustment will offer this solution for him. </p2>
                        
                        <p> Midfield: Casemiro, Ugarte, Bruno Fernandes</p>
                        <p2> In all honesty, this was the toughest decision I've had to make in a long time, I almost got emotional excluding Mainoo from the midfield 3 as he's personally my favourite player and objectively offers qualities unique to him in the squad right now. With that being said, I do have to consider the factors I mentioned previously, abiding by what Ten Hag would be most likely to do; which is stick by his captain, Bruno Fernandes, and his most senior, accomplished midfielder in Casemiro. If I made the final call, he would be my go-to substitution at the end of a game to hold a lead in place of Kobbie, but unfortunately I don't so se will see him alongside Bruno and the new signing Manuel Ugarte, who would offer serious out of possession quality, and will be able to do an adequate job in progressing the ball through the thirds to our attackers alongside Casemiro. <br> This would leave Bruno being the most advanced player, allowing him to hold most of the midfield's creative responsibility. As frustrating as he can be, he can also be very prolific in this role so we just have to hope the setup of the team brings out the good in him far mmore often than not. Finally, given EtH's desire for intense pressing, having 3 of our better out of possession players will suit this. There is a shout for Mount to be considered in that case, but due to his in-possession mediocrity, he'd struggle to make it in over Bruno in the advanced role - the only role he can play here. </p2> 

                        <p> Attack: Amad, Zirkzee, Rashford</p>
                        <p2> This combination may not be popular among the fanbase at this moment in time. Judging by the fan resction to Rashford not being subbed off against liverpool, many people would be pleased to not see him start until he plays his way back in to the squad, because many people have run out of patience with him. While I'm not distancing myself from those people, I also maintain the fact that he offers more over the course of a game than Garnacho currently, and for that reason he should start on the left. <br> Plus, with the adjustments mentioned in the defence section, we shoud see an upturn in his form. The reason why I chose Amad over Garnacho too is because Amad is currently our best performing and is also the creative spark out of all of our attacking options. He is currently the only winger capable of consistently creating chances for both himself and his teammates, and to me, he deserves to be in the lineup as a result. <br> Finally, Zirkzee. I would say he's been somewhat unlucky so far in Red, both for better and worse; with his fortunate goal against Fulham, the severely unfortunate disallowed goal against Brighton, and having to go up against Van Dijk and Konate in your first start too isn't the most ideal introduction to English football. With that being said, his overall striker abilities is solid, but in-possession qualities create a large gap between him and Hojlund to me, he finds no difficulty in trapping the ball and bringing the rest of his teammates into play, unlike his counterpart; which compliments the likes of Bruno and Rashford immensely. As a result, he must start. <br>  Hopefully we can see something like this in our forthcoming matches.</p2>

                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p> Goalkeeper: Altay Bayindir </p>
                        <p2> He is the cup goalkeeper and we expect him to protect the sticks for these inferior games, though last year the coach normally opted for minimal changes all over.</p2>

                        <p> Defence: Mazaroui, Yoro, Maguire, Amass </p>
                        <p2> For the right back role, Mazaroui and Dalot are interchangeable based on who needs a rest, they both provide similar qualities on and off the ball, though I would say Dalot edges him currently. Harry Maguire has really fixed his reputation with those who watch him play in the last 6-8 months, and has proven he definitely possesses adequate technical, physical and mental qualities, enough to be at least the 3/4th choice CB currently. <br> Leny Yoro is an incredibly raw talent at the club, and in a position like CB, where your game understanding is imperative to being top in your position, he will (by no fault of his own) be lacking in that regard solely due to his age and only playing 1 full season of professional football. These midweek games will do him a world of good in growing in this regard, and will also allow him to embrace his style as a "sweeper" type defender, by being alongside a more front-footed leader like Maguire. <br> Finally, Harry Amass will certainly see the pitch in these games. Not only due to his evident potential, but by virtue of our lack of players able to play in this position; with Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia both being unavailable. As a young player playing against "lesser" oppossiton, similar to Yoro, he should be able to develop reasonably well in these matches and cultivate that game understanding that is required of a defender at this club. </p2>
                        
                        <p> Midfield: Mainoo, Ugarte, Mount</p>
                        <p2> This midfield picks itself for the most part. Mount and Mainoo unfortunately miss out on the Premier League lineup - Mainoo for a combination of balance purposes, age, and anticipating how EtH would act, and Mount due to him currently not performing well enough to deserve a starting spot by any means. Meanwhile, Ugarte has stayed in based on the simple fact that he is significantly younger than Casemiro, therefore being more likely to be able to handle 2 games a week playing this style of football, and also Collyer's rawness too making him a risk to start these games currently. However, based on his usage during pre-season accompanied by his continued squad inclusion since, he will definitely be picking up 20/30 minutes off the bench where possible.</p2> 
                        
                        <p> Attack: Antony, Hojlund, Garnacho </p>
                        <p2> The front 3. To me, this is a very straightorward decision. In my opinion, these 3 players are all inferior to thei counterparts in the Premier League lineup. Arguments can be made for Hojlund and Garnacho to both be in that squad, but for the reasons described in the Premier League forwards section, there would be no benefit doing so. <br> With respect to Antony, he has not had the best 24 months in a United shirt, with many people calling for him to be shipped out to any willing bidder. However, from a tactical standpoint, his subconscious ability to provide width and be an option for the ball to (try and) combine with others, as well as his defensive discipline - while not attributes you would ever see on a scout report for any type of professional footballer - are positives nonetheless. Him using these games to string some decent performances together and build confidence intrinsically and from his coaches/teammates will hopefully assist him in reaching his pre-United levels and potentially even spur him on to become the winger the coach felt positive about spending 80m Euros on. </p2>
