                        <p>In recent times, the international break has often been the best period in the year for Man United fans - solely because there are no United games to ruin your weekend; and oftentimes, ruin the the following week as well. Instead, we usually spend 2 weeks reminiscing about all the great (and not so great) players we used to have, that gave us memorable moments - since most of the current crop haven't been providing these for us! However, today, we will use the 3 games we've played so far to deduce the best lineup we have at our disposal, accounting for: balance, the coach's style, "form", fitness but also a certain degree of realism - choosing players that Ten Hag would most likely play himself. Before we select players, we must first decide on a formation...</p>

                            This is like a riddle that even the coaches themselves can't seem to solve - luckily I'm here to reveal the answers! 
                            In my opinion, the only issue, when it comes to the formation (we have MANY issues elsewhere) is the midfield. Do we go with a 2-man pivot or just one sitter (a '6'? Do we play with a designated attacking midfielder or do we have 2 central midfielders ('8s') "sharing" that responsibilty? I personally would opt for a 6 with twin 8s either side; just to close up the gaps we constantly see in the midfield. Even though you can solve this with better coaching, it's clear that ETH isn't meeting the needed standards to this formation would be beneficial as a result. 
                            Now this has been established, the lineup will be a 4-3-3 with a 6 and two 8s.</p>

                        <p>
                            Now, I've had to adjust the team for availability, as ideally Luke Shaw would be in the lineup, but given his recent lack of availabaility for the team, and obscurity as to when he'll next play for us, he, among others, won't be included here.
                            Also, we'll have a lineup specifically for Premier League games and one for Europa League/Domestic Cup games for squad rotation and to get the younger players involved.

                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p> Goalkeeper: Onana </p>
                        <p2> Even though he has been relatively poor compared to how he ended last season, he is still undisputedly the best person for the job.</p2>

                        <p> Defence: Dalot, De Ligt, Martinez, Mazaroui </p>
                        <p2>Honestly, I didn't think this unit was too bad in their last outing against liverpool (H), especially De Ligt. As the game went on, we were seeing the back 4 become more and more exposed, and unfortunately Martinez evidently lost his head and became overly rash - which didn't do any United player any favours. De Ligt manages this well however, and still proved to be of the calibre he left Ajax at, and gave hope that he could potentially fulfil his potential here. I have also switched the full-backs. Even though they have both been good - and I am a believer of the saying "If it ain't broke don't fix it", I still think this switch will serve the rest of the team better; here's where the "balance" I spoke about comes in. So far, Dalot's listed position has been at LB, but he often operates in the middle areas of the pitch in possession, leaving Rashford to hug the touchline. I believe this should be mirrored on the other side, with the right winger doing this instead to enable Rashford to invert and pick up the ball in more shooting positions, because even though he has been poor for the last 12 months, one attribute he's kept this whole time is his ball-striking ability; and the fact that he hasn't had a shot on goal is criminal. So this adjustment will offer this solution for him. </p2>
                        
                        <p> Midfield: Casemiro, Ugarte, Bruno</p>
                        <p2> In all honesty, this was the toughest decision I've had to make in a long time, I almost got emotional excluding Mainoo from the midfield 3 as he's personally my favourite player and objectively offers qualities unique to him in the squad right now. With that being said, I do have to consider the factors I mentioned previously, abiding by what Ten Hag would be most likely to do; which is stick by his captain, Bruno Fernandes, and his most senior, accomplished midfielder in Casemiro. If I made the final call, he would be my go-to substitution at the end of a game to hold a lead in place of Kobbie, but unfortunately I don't so se will see him alongside new signing Bruno and the new signing Manuel Ugarte, who would offer serious out of possession quality, and will be able to do an adequate job in progressing the ball through the thirds to our attackers alongside Casemiro. This would leave Bruno being the most advanced player, allowing him to hold most of the midfield's creative responsibility. As frustrating as he can be, he can also be very prolific in this role so we just have to hope the setup of the team brings out the good in him far mmore often than not. Finally, given EtH's desire for intense pressing, having 3 of our better out of possession players will suit this. There is a shout for Mount to be considered in that case, but due to his in-possession mediocrity, he'd struggle to make it in over Bruno in the advanced role - the only role he can play here. </p2> 

                        <p> Attack: Amad, Zirkzee, Rashford</p>
                        <p2> This combination may not be popular among the fanbase at this moment in time. Judging by the fan resction to Rashford not being subbed off against liverpool, many people would be pleased to not see him start until he plays his way back in to the squad, because many people have run out of patience with him. While I'm not distancing myself from those people, I also maintain the fact that he offers more over the course of a game than Garnacho currently, and for that reason he should start on the left. Plus, with the adjustments mentioned in the defence section, we shoud see an upturn in his form. The reason why I chose Amad over Garnacho too is because Amad is currently our best performing and is also the creative spark out of all of our attacking options. He is currently the only winger capable of consistently creating chances for both himself and his teammates, and to me, he deserves to be in the lineup as a result. Finally, Zirkzee. I would say he's been somewhat unlucky so far in Red, both for better and worse; with his fortunate goal against Fulham, the severely unfortunate disallowed goal against Brighton, and having to go up against Van Dijk and Konate in your first start too isn't the most ideal introduction to ENglish football. WIth that being said, his overall striker abilities is solid, but in-possession qualities create a large gap between him and Hojlund to me, he finds no difficulty in trapping the ball and bringing the rest of his teammates into play, unlike his counterpart; which compliments the likes of Bruno and Rashford immensely. As a result, he must start.</p2>
